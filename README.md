# Landing Page Project

### Author: Ahmed Abd Al-fattah Abd Al-sattar

## Project Description:
Building a landing page with multiple sections, and a navigational menu that is dynamically updated using Javascript based on the number of sections added to HTML body element.


## Benifits
This project offers a chance to combine HTML, CSS, and Javascript knowledge to build a landing page in which Javascript dynamically updates some of its content such as building navigation bar links based on the number of sections present within the page, adding active state to the section while being in the viewport, scrolling to a specific section when clicking on its name in the navigation bar, and adding active state to the navigation bar links when clicked on or its corresponding section is in the viewport. Such projects solidify our knowledge and deepen our comprehension of Javascript concepts that require practice to master.
